\section{Ecosystem}

\soft{HALFpipe} has been developed as an open-source project and is accepting contributions that offer new features, enhance functionality, or improve efficiency. All changes are tracked using the \soft{Git} version control system, which is the de-facto standard in the open source community. Additionally, before inclusion in the source tree, changes will be reviewed and then undergo automated testing, which includes unit tests and also running an entire analysis for one subject of the OpenNeuro dataset ds000108 \parencite{wager2008}. This way unexpected side effects and bugs will be caught and corrected before causing problems for users.

\soft{HALFpipe} releases are made using semantic versioning as adapted for compatibility with Python \parencite{coghlan2013}. This means that there will be feature releases that add new functionality and patch releases that make minor adjustments to solve specific issues or bugs. The development team takes great care that new patch releases of dependencies such as \soft{fMRIPrep} are regularly incorporated into \soft{HALFpipe} so that bug fixes are made available to users.

\soft{HALFpipe} currently depends on the long-term support release 20.2.x of \soft{fMRIPrep}. For future releases containing new features, the developers will approve  possible upgrades that are advantageous to ENIGMA consortium projects. We may also consider replacing tools used for specific processing steps or upgrading the standard brain template in future releases based on such considerations, which will be explained in the change log of each release.
