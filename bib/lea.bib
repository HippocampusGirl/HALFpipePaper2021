	abstract = {This review summarizes the last decade of work by the ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta Analysis) Consortium, a global alliance of over 1400 scientists across 43 countries, studying the human brain in health and disease. Building on large-scale genetic studies that discovered the first robustly replicated genetic loci associated with brain metrics, ENIGMA has diversified into over 50 working groups (WGs), pooling worldwide data and expertise to answer fundamental questions in neuroscience, psychiatry, neurology, and genetics. Most ENIGMA WGs focus on specific psychiatric and neurological conditions, other WGs study normal variation due to sex and gender differences, or development and aging; still other WGs develop methodological pipelines and tools to facilitate harmonized analyses of “big data” (i.e., genetic and epigenetic data, multimodal MRI, and electroencephalography data). These international efforts have yielded the largest neuroimaging studies to date in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. More recent ENIGMA WGs have formed to study anxiety disorders, suicidal thoughts and behavior, sleep and insomnia, eating disorders, irritability, brain injury, antisocial personality and conduct disorder, and dissociative identity disorder. Here, we summarize the first decade of ENIGMA’s activities and ongoing projects, and describe the successes and challenges encountered along the way. We highlight the advantages of collaborative large-scale coordinated data analyses for testing reproducibility and robustness of findings, offering the opportunity to identify brain systems involved in clinical syndromes across diverse samples and associated genetic, environmental, demographic, cognitive, and psychosocial factors.},

	abstract = {Big data and large-scale biobanks offer the potential to answer new types of questions as well as address older questions with greater confidence and rigor in order to overcome the ‘crisis of reproducibility’ in the neurosciences, in which findings from small datasets were often not replicated in independent samples. A recent paradigm shift has led to the formation of large-scale consortia that pool resources from around the world and significantly improve the power to establish the effects of genetics, and a large range of psychiatric disorders, on the brain in populations worldwide. The individual studies with diverse datasets from people with different ethnic and cultural backgrounds can now be pooled to combine evidence across collaborative studies to determine the robust brain signatures of psychiatric disorders, as well as factors that modulate them. In this chapter, we describe some of the efforts underway internationally to analyze mental health data in a coordinated way, as well as some of the challenges in comparing data from different studies. We discuss “Big Data” as international neuroimaging and genetic data, the need for large scale efforts in brain imaging and genetics, and the activities and findings from the psychiatry focused groups of the ENIGMA consortium, efforts developed to bring together researchers and resources to improve our understanding of how psychiatric disorders affect brain structure and function.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging has played an important part in advancing our understanding of the neurobiology of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). At the same time, neuroimaging studies of OCD have had notable limitations, including reliance on relatively small samples. International collaborative efforts to increase statistical power by combining samples from across sites have been bolstered by the ENIGMA consortium; this provides specific technical expertise for conducting multi-site analyses, as well as access to a collaborative community of neuroimaging scientists. In this article, we outline the background to, development of, and initial findings from ENIGMA's OCD working group, which currently consists of 47 samples from 34 institutes in 15 countries on 5 continents, with a total sample of 2,323 OCD patients and 2,325 healthy controls. Initial work has focused on studies of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes, structural connectivity, and brain lateralization in children, adolescents and adults with OCD, also including the study on the commonalities and distinctions across different neurodevelopment disorders. Additional work is ongoing, employing machine learning techniques. Findings to date have contributed to the development of neurobiological models of OCD, have provided an important model of global scientific collaboration, and have had a number of clinical implications. Importantly, our work has shed new light on questions about whether structural and functional alterations found in OCD reflect neurodevelopmental changes, effects of the disease process, or medication impacts. We conclude with a summary of ongoing work by ENIGMA-OCD, and a consideration of future directions for neuroimaging research on OCD within and beyond ENIGMA.},

	abstract = {In functional magnetic resonance imaging statistical analysis there are problems with accounting for temporal autocorrelations when assessing change within voxels. Techniques to date have utilized temporal filtering strategies to either shape these autocorrelations or remove them. Shaping, or “coloring,” attempts to negate the effects of not accurately knowing the intrinsic autocorrelations by imposing known autocorrelation via temporal filtering. Removing the autocorrelation, or “prewhitening,” gives the best linear unbiased estimator, assuming that the autocorrelation is accurately known. For single-event designs, the efficiency of the estimator is considerably higher for prewhitening compared with coloring. However, it has been suggested that sufficiently accurate estimates of the autocorrelation are currently not available to give prewhitening acceptable bias. To overcome this, we consider different ways to estimate the autocorrelation for use in prewhitening. After high-pass filtering is performed, a Tukey taper (set to smooth the spectral density more than would normally be used in spectral density estimation) performs best. Importantly, estimation is further improved by using nonlinear spatial filtering to smooth the estimated autocorrelation, but only within tissue type. Using this approach when prewhitening reduced bias to close to zero at probability levels as low as 1 × 10−5.},

	abstract = {The field of neuroimaging has embraced the need for sharing and collaboration. Data sharing mandates from public funding agencies and major journal publishers have spurred the development of data repositories and neuroinformatics consortia. However, efficient and effective data sharing still faces several hurdles. For example, open data sharing is on the rise but is not suitable for sensitive data that are not easily shared, such as genetics. Current approaches can be cumbersome (such as negotiating multiple data sharing agreements). There are also significant data transfer, organization and computational challenges. Centralized repositories only partially address the issues. We propose a dynamic, decentralized platform for large scale analyses called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The COINSTAC solution can include data missing from central repositories, allows pooling of both open and ``closed'' repositories by developing privacy-preserving versions of widely-used algorithms, and incorporates the tools within an easy-to-use platform enabling distributed computation. We present an initial prototype system which we demonstrate on two multi-site data sets, without aggregating the data. In addition, by iterating across sites, the COINSTAC model enables meta-analytic solutions to converge to ``pooled-data'' solutions (i.e. as if the entire data were in hand). More advanced approaches such as feature generation, matrix factorization models, and preprocessing can be incorporated into such a model. In sum, COINSTAC enables access to the many currently unavailable data sets, a user friendly privacy enabled interface for decentralized analysis, and a powerful solution that complements existing data sharing solutions.},

The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of a new procedure, “smoothness equalization”, on reducing scanner differences in activation effect size as part of a multicenter fMRI project (FIRST BIRN). Five subjects were sent to 9 centers (10 scanners) and scanned on 2 consecutive days using a sensorimotor fMRI protocol. High-field (4 T and 3 T) and low-field (1.5 T) scanners from three vendors (GE, Siemens, and Picker) were included. The activation effect size of the scanners for the detection of neural activation during a sensorimotor task was evaluated as the percent of temporal variance accounted for by our model (percent of variance accounted for or PVAF). Marked scanner effects were noted for both PVAF as well as the degree of smoothness of the raw and processed images. After smoothness equalization, there was a dramatic (low field) or consistent (high-field) reduction in scanner-to-scanner variation of activation. It was shown that the likely basis of the scanner differences in smoothness was differences in k-space filtering algorithms. This work highlights the need to account for differences in smoothness when comparing scanners on activation effect size in multicenter fMRI studies.},
